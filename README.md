# Design and Implementation of Virtual Reality for Learning about Chemical Reactions using Unity Tool

- Developed as part of a master's thesis to create a system for teaching chemical reactions using virtual reality tailored to elementary school students.
- Provides an interactive learning experience through experimentation with various chemical reactions.
- Utilizes virtual reality to offer an immersive environment for observing, experimenting, and understanding chemical reactions dynamically.
- Allows students to track changes in states of matter, observe real-time reactions, and explore the impact of different factors on reaction outcomes.
- Incorporates interactive tasks and challenges to deepen students' understanding of chemical concepts and processes.
- Emphasizes adherence to pedagogical principles to ensure educational value and promote active learning.
